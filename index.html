<h1>COIN DETAILS</h1>

<pre>BMW uses it's own original codebase written completely from scratch, with learnings from the BEAM and GRIN codebases.</pre>

<pre>BMW is based on Proof of Work, utilizing the XBS algorithm, allowing users to mine coins while contributing to the network. Unlike other MW implementations, BMW is not susceptible to 51% attacks by large miners. The XBS algorithm uses a novel approach to double spending attacks, but requiring proof of work upon reorganization that is only possible for a distributed effort of legitimate actors on the network.</pre>

<pre>BMW supports a transaction model inspired by Bitcoin, making it simple to support addresses and simple offline send-and-forget transactions.</pre>


<h1>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</h1>
