    <h2>Bitcoin MimbleWimble</h2>
    <p>The biggest innovation since the creation of Bitcoin may very well be MimbleWimble, a project introduced anonymously, and proven to have sparked interest with popular altcoins like Grin, Beam, and MimbleWimbleCoin.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin MimbleWimble is a coin that combines the best of the forked MW projects in to one master MimbleWimble coin that can provide a true sustainable future for MimbleWimble, sharing the growth qualities of Bitcoin.</p>

    <h1>CLAIMING YOUR COINS</h1>

    On March 28th, the BMW development team will launch it's mainnet, and issue an initial set of coins to those holding any of the following coins, and in the following ratio:
    </p>
    <pre>
    GRIN - 10 BMW for every 1 GRIN
    BEAM - 10 BMW for every 1 BEAM
    MWC - 5 BMW for every 1 MWC
    BITGRIN - 3 BMW for every 1 BITGRIN
    EPIC CASH - 1 BMW for every 1 EPIC CASH
    GRIMM - 1 BMW for every 1 GRIMM

    <h1>COIN DETAILS</h1>

    <p>BMW uses it's own original codebase written completely from scratch, with learnings from the BEAM and GRIN codebases.</p>

    <p>BMW is based on Proof of Work, utilizing the XBS algorithm, allowing users to mine coins while contributing to the network. Unlike other MW implementations, BMW is not susceptible to 51% attacks by large miners. The XBS algorithm uses a novel approach to double spending attacks, but requiring proof of work upon reorganization that is only possible for a distributed effort of legitimate actors on the network.</p>

    <p>BMW supports a transaction model inspired by Bitcoin, making it simple to support addresses and simple offline send-and-forget transactions.</p>


    <h1>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</h1>
